name: nutrigram_app
description: Nutrition is the main source of life and although it has been our
  secondary instinct to check for nutritional value in the food we eat, the
  effect any diet has in our body and health is consequential. From the fact
  which connotes the value of nutrition in our diet, springs the idea of
  nutri.gram. nutri.gram is a mobile application that scans the food label
  present in the packaged food items and draws a significant conclusion from
  that data regarding its edibleness for a person, the nutritional worth it adds
  to our diet, how much calorific value it provides per serving and much more.
  This application is targeted to anyone who wants to get insight into what they
  are feeding into their body and how understanding the nutritional value will
  be of tremendous aid to their overall health.

flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/illustrations/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/overlay/

  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: WorkSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: fonts/WorkSans-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
